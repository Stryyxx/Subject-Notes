			<p class="mb-4">
				Conversion methods are how firms and enterprise roll out new features or systems to a platform or their users.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Types of Conversion Methods</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">There are several types of conversion methods, including:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-8">
				<li>Direct Conversions</li>
				<li>Phased Conversions</li>
				<li>Parallel Conversions</li>
				<li>Pilot Conversions</li>
			</ul>

						<span id="arrow-directDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="directDetails" class="hidden bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-md">
						<p>
							A direct conversion is when a company stops using the old system and starts using the new system at a
							specific point in time. This can be risky because even with sufficient testing, it is impossible to make
							sure there are no issues with the new system.
						</p>

					<button
						class="w-full text-left bg-blue-500 text-white p-3 rounded focus:outline-none flex justify-between items-center"

					>
						<span>Phased Conversions</span>
						<span id="arrow-phasedDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="phasedDetails" class="hidden bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-md">
						<p>
							Phased conversion is a conversion that is slowly integrated with the new and slowly removes the old. An
							example of this is a school has a new system to manage sports and each team’s athletes. The old system is
							paper and pencil. Over time, a new system is introduced to manage students, their teams, seasons, and
							their coaches. At ﬁrst, the new system manages teams. Then the new system manages seasons (and school
							terms). When users are familiar with that process, the system is expanded to include the management of
							coaches, players, and events. At the end of implementation, the new system manages everything related to
							student athletics and the old paper and pencil system is no longer used.

						<span id="arrow-parallelDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="parallelDetails" class="hidden bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-md">
						<p>
							The new system is introduced while the old one is still in use. Both systems process all activity and the
							results are compared. Once there is confidence that the new one operates properly, the old one is shut
							down.

						<span id="arrow-pilotDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="pilotDetails" class="hidden bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-md">
						<p>
							Pilot Conversions are when part of an organisation uses the new system while the rest of it continues to
							use the old. This localises problems to the pilot group so support resources can focus on it. However,
							there can be interface issues where organisational units share data.
