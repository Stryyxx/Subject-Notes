			<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Conversion Methods</h1>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Conversion methods are how firms and enterprise roll out new features or systems to a platform or their users.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Types of Conversion Methods</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">There are several types of conversion methods, including:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
				<li>Direct Conversions</li>
				<li>Phased Conversions</li>
				<li>Parallel Conversions</li>
				<li>Pilot Conversions</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Direct Conversions</h3>
			<p>
				A direct conversion is when a company stops using the old system and starts using the new system at a specific
				point in time. This can be risky because even with sufficient testing, it is impossible to make sure there are
				no issues with the new system.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Phased Conversions</h3>
			<p>
				Phased conversion is a conversion that is slowly integrated with the new and slowly removes the old. An example
				of this is a school has a new system to manage sports and each team’s athletes. The old system is paper and
				pencil. Over time, a new system is introduced to manage students, their teams, seasons, and their coaches. At
				ﬁrst, the new system manages teams. Then the new system manages seasons (and school terms). When users are
				familiar with that process, the system is expanded to include the management of coaches, players, and events. At
				the end of implementation, the new system manages everything related to student athletics and the old paper and
				pencil system is no longer used.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Parallel Conversions</h3>
			<p>
				The new system is introduced while the old one is still in use. Both systems process all activity and the
				results are compared. Once there is confidence that the new one operates properly, the old one is shut down.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-8">Pilot Conversions</h3>
			<p>
				Pilot Conversions are when part of an organisation uses the new system while the rest of it continues to use the
				old. This localises problems to the pilot group so support resources can focus on it. However, there can be
				interface issues where organisational units share data.
