							Cloud computing involves delivering computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking,
							software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are
							called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how
							you’re billed for water or electricity at home.
