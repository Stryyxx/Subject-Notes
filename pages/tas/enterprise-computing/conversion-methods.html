			<p class="p1">
				Conversion methods are how firms and enterprises roll out new features or systems to a platform or their users.
			</p>
			<h2 class="h2">Types of Conversion Methods</h2>
			<p class="p1">There are several types of conversion methods, including:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Direct Conversions</li>
				<li>Phased Conversions</li>
				<li>Parallel Conversions</li>
				<li>Pilot Conversions</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Conversion Methods Details -->

				<div>
					<button class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDetails('directDetails')">
						<span>Direct Conversions</span>
						<span id="arrow-directDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="directDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							A direct conversion is when a company stops using the old system and starts using the new system at a
							specific point in time. This can be risky because even with sufficient testing, it is impossible to make
							sure there are no issues with the new system.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<button class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDetails('phasedDetails')">
						<span>Phased Conversions</span>
						<span id="arrow-phasedDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="phasedDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							Phased conversion is a conversion that is slowly integrated with the new and slowly removes the old. An
							example of this is a school with a new system to manage sports and each team’s athletes. The old system is
							paper and pencil. Over time, a new system is introduced to manage students, their teams, seasons, and
							their coaches. At ﬁrst, the new system manages teams. Then the new system manages seasons (and school
							terms). When users are familiar with that process, the system is expanded to include the management of
							coaches, players, and events. At the end of implementation, the new system manages everything related to
							student athletics and the old paper and pencil system is no longer used.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<button class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDetails('parallelDetails')">
						<span>Parallel Conversions</span>
						<span id="arrow-parallelDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="parallelDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The new system is introduced while the old one is still in use. Both systems process all activity and the
							results are compared. Once there is confidence that the new one operates properly, the old one is shut
							down.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<button class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDetails('pilotDetails')">
						<span>Pilot Conversions</span>
						<span id="arrow-pilotDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="pilotDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							Pilot Conversions are when part of an organization uses the new system while the rest of it continues to
							use the old. This localizes problems to the pilot group so support resources can focus on it. However,
							there can be interface issues where organizational units share data.
