						<p>
							3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a process of making three-dimensional solid objects from a
							digital file. The creation of a 3D-printed object is achieved using additive processes, where an object is
							created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is complete. Each of these layers
							can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.
