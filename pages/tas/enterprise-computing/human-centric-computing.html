				Human-centric computing (HCC) focuses on the design and development of technology solutions that prioritize the
				needs, experiences, and interactions of human users. This approach ensures that technology is intuitive,
				accessible, and beneficial to the end-user.

							Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field of study focused on the design and use of computer technology,
							emphasizing the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in HCI observe the ways
							humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in
							novel ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							HCI incorporates multiple disciplines, including computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media
							studies, and several other fields of study.

							User Experience (UX) involves a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system,
							or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful, and valuable aspects of
							human-computer interaction and product ownership.
						</p>
						<p>
							UX is subjective in nature because it is about an individual's perception and thought with respect to the
							system. UX includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful, and valuable aspects of
							human-computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person's perceptions of
							system aspects such as utility, ease of use, and efficiency.
