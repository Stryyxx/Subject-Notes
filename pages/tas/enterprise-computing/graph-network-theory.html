							Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to
							model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges (or
							arcs). Network theory is an extension of graph theory that focuses on the analysis of complex networks,
							such as social networks, communication networks, and biological networks.
