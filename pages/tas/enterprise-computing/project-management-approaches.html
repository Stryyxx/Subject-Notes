						<p>
							Outsourcing is employed when a development team lacks the skills or resources for a specific part of a
							project. By contracting an external team, the project manager ensures that the project stays on track
							while the in-house team can focus on other tasks.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							<b>Example:</b> A project manager might hire a web design company to develop the website portion of an
							information system.

						<p>
							End-users are involved throughout the development process to ensure the system meets their needs. This
							approach guarantees that the final product is user-friendly and satisfies the intended audience.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							<b>Example:</b> End-users participate in every stage of development, from requirement gathering to
							testing.

					<div id="agileDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							Agile methodology focuses on flexibility and adaptability, with regular iterations and feedback loops.
							This method is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change during development.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Effective communication, team management, and frequent meetings are critical to the success of the Agile
							approach.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							<b>Example:</b> Daily stand-ups and progress reviews help track project milestones and adapt to changes.
