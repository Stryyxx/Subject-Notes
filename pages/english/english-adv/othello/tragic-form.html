			<h1 class="h1">The Tragic Form</h1>
			<p class="p1">
				Othello is a prime example of a classical tragedy, where the tragic form is defined by the downfall of a noble
				character due to a combination of personal flaws and external forces. The play explores themes of fate, free
				will, and the consequences of human error.
			</p>

						<p>
							Othello, as the tragic hero, is a man of high status and noble character, whose tragic flaw (hamartia)
							leads to his downfall. His jealousy, manipulated by Iago, drives the plot toward its tragic conclusion.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li><b>High Status:</b> Othello is a respected general, admired for his military prowess.</li>
							<li><b>Hamartia:</b> His jealousy and trust in Iago become the catalysts for his tragic fall.</li>
							<li>
								<b>Hubris:</b> Othello's pride prevents him from seeing the truth about Iago and Desdemona until it is
								too late.
							</li>

					<div id="epistemologicalCrisisDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The epistemological crisis in Othello revolves around the conflict between appearance and reality.
							Othello's inability to discern the truth leads to his tragic decisions, as he relies on Iago's deceitful
							words rather than his own judgment.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Appearance vs. Reality:</b> Iago's manipulations create a false reality for Othello, leading him to
								mistrust Desdemona.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Misinterpretation:</b> Othello misinterprets events and actions, contributing to his tragic errors.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							The concept of catharsis refers to the emotional release experienced by the audience as they witness the
							tragic events unfold. In Othello, the audience feels pity for the protagonist and fear of the consequences
							of his actions, culminating in a moral lesson.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Pity:</b> The audience sympathizes with Othello, despite his flaws, as they see how Iago's
								manipulations lead to his tragic end.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Fear:</b> The play evokes fear by illustrating the destructive power of jealousy and the consequences
								of misplaced trust.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Moral Lesson:</b> The tragedy serves as a warning about the dangers of letting emotions cloud
								judgment.
