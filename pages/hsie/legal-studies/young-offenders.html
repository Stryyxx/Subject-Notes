			<p>
				Young offenders are treated differently in the legal system, considering their age, rights, and the nature of
				their crimes. The following sections provide detailed notes on various aspects related to young offenders.

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How an Offenders’ Age Affects Their Treatment</h2>
					<p>
						Children often don’t understand the full consequence of their actions because of their age, meaning they
						lack mens rea (criminal intent to commit crimes).
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Doli Incapax</h3>
					<p>
						Children often don’t understand the full consequence of their actions because of their age and are incapable
						of crime.
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
						<li>
							UN Convention on the Right of the Child (CROC) Article 40: There should be a minimum age for assuming that
							children have the capacity to break the law.
						</li>
						<li>
							Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act NSW: In NSW, children under 10 are assumed to be doli incapax.
							However, between the ages of 10-14, the presumption that the child is doli incapax is rebuttable (can be
							contested). Children over 14 aren’t protected under doli incapax.
						</li>
						<li>
							R v LMW (1999): 10-year-old LMW pushed 6-year-old Corey Davis into a river. Corey drowned and LMW was
							charged with manslaughter. As he is between the ages 10-14, doli incapax is rebuttable. The court found
							this was a case of bullying gone wrong and that LMW had no intention to make Corey die when he pushed him.

						Law Enforcement (Power and Responsibilities) Act (LEPRA): All guidelines for police actions are contained in

					<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
						<li>
							<b>C: Contact Parents</b>: Parents must be contacted whenever a child is brought in for questioning and

						<li><b>L: Legal Aid</b>: A child must be told they can get access to legal aid.</li>
						<li>
							<b>A: Adult Present</b>: There must be a guardian or support person present for the child’s questioning.

						<li>
							<b>S: Search and Seizure</b>: Police can search children in the same way as adults and seize unlawful

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Children's Court</h2>
					<p>
						The Children's Court is a specialized court for dealing with crimes committed by children. However, serious
						indictable offences committed by a child can be tried in an adult court (e.g., manslaughter or violent
						crimes).
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
						<li>
							Recognizes that children are vulnerable and need to be rehabilitated rather than dealt with harshly.
						</li>
						<li>
							The court aims to be informal and inclusive, discussing the child’s issue with specially trained
							personnel.
						</li>
						<li>Procedures are closed to the public, and media outlets cannot publish names.</li>
						<li>No jury or debating lawyers are involved.</li>
						<li>Social workers prepare background reports considering family, social, and health situations.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These processes are governed by the Children’s Court Act 1987, reflecting the Convention of the Rights of
						the Child (CROC).

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Criticisms</h2>
					<p>
						There have been criticisms stating that the Children’s Court has not been focusing enough on rehabilitation,
						with too many young offenders placed in prison.
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
						<li>
							The Seen and Heard Report (1997) stated that incarceration, particularly in NSW, is not well dealt with.
						</li>
						<li>
							Children are often placed on remand in the same prisons as convicted child offenders, exposing them to
							negative influences.
						</li>
						<li>High reoffence rate for children who have been to juvenile justice centres in NSW (68.5%).</li>
						<li>
							Differences in detention rates: Victoria focuses on diversionary programs (83 juveniles in detention each
							day) compared to NSW (390 juveniles in detention each day).

							Failure to comply can result in consequences ranging from fines to imprisonment.

						<li>
							<b>Youth Justice Conference</b>: The court orders the youth to confront their victim and resolve the issue
							in a facilitated conference.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Fine</b>: The young offender may be given a fine up to $1100, considering the child’s age and ability
							to repay.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Community Service</b>: The child must contribute to community service, with the amount of time
							dependent on their age (up to 100 hours for under 16, up to 250 hours for over 16).
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Control Order</b>: Similar to imprisonment for adults but cannot exceed 2 years. The term 'control
							order' is used to reduce the stigma associated with the word 'prison'.
