			<p class="p1">
				The Holocaust had a profound impact on Jewish immigration to Palestine and the British response to it. The
				desperate plight of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution heightened tensions in Palestine, as Britain
				struggled to balance its commitments to both Jews and Arabs under its mandate.

							British policies during the Holocaust were shaped by the need to maintain order in Palestine while
							managing international pressure to allow more Jewish refugees to enter. The White Paper of 1939 restricted
							Jewish immigration, even as the scale of the Holocaust became known.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Immigration Restrictions:</b> The 1939 White Paper limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 over five
								years, with further immigration subject to Arab consent.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Refugee Crisis:</b> Britain’s refusal to allow more Jewish refugees into Palestine led to criticism
								from Zionists and international observers.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Post-War Pressure:</b> After the war, Britain faced increasing pressure to allow Holocaust survivors
								to settle in Palestine, leading to the eventual abandonment of the White Paper policy.

							The Holocaust had a lasting impact on the Arab-Israeli conflict, as the memory of Jewish suffering fueled
							Zionist determination to establish a secure Jewish state, while also exacerbating Arab fears of further
							Jewish immigration.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Zionist Resolve:</b> The horrors of the Holocaust strengthened the resolve of Zionist leaders to
								establish a Jewish state as a refuge for Jews worldwide.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Arab Opposition:</b> The prospect of increased Jewish immigration after the war heightened Arab
								opposition, leading to greater tensions and violence.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>International Sympathy:</b> Global sympathy for Holocaust survivors influenced international support
								for the establishment of Israel, despite Arab objections.
