			<p class="p1">
				The Balfour Agreement, issued in 1917, was a letter from British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord
				Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, expressing the British government’s support for the
				establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. The declaration was a significant step
				toward the creation of the state of Israel, but it also laid the groundwork for conflict with the Arab
				population of Palestine.
