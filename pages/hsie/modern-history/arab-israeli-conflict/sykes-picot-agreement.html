			<p class="p1">
				The Sykes-Picot Agreement, signed in 1916, was a secret treaty between Britain and France, with the assent of
				Russia, dividing the Ottoman Empire’s territories in the Middle East between them. The agreement had a
				significant impact on the region, setting the stage for modern-day borders and conflicts.

							The Sykes-Picot Agreement divided the Middle East into British and French spheres of influence, with areas
							of direct and indirect control. This division ignored ethnic and religious boundaries, leading to
							long-term tensions.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>French Mandate:</b> France was given control over modern-day Syria and Lebanon, as well as influence
								over parts of southeastern Turkey.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>British Mandate:</b> Britain was granted control over modern-day Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine, with
								additional influence in the Persian Gulf.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Impact on Arabs:</b> The agreement contradicted earlier promises made to Arab leaders regarding
								independence, leading to feelings of betrayal and resentment.
							</li>

							The Sykes-Picot Agreement had profound long-term effects on the Middle East, contributing to the creation
							of artificial borders that have fueled conflicts and tensions throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Artificial Borders:</b> The borders drawn by the agreement often disregarded the ethnic, religious,
								and tribal realities on the ground, leading to instability.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Rise of Nationalism:</b> The agreement spurred Arab nationalism and a sense of betrayal, leading to
								resistance against colonial powers.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Ongoing Conflicts:</b> Many of the conflicts in the Middle East, including the Arab-Israeli conflict,
								can be traced back to the divisions imposed by Sykes-Picot.
