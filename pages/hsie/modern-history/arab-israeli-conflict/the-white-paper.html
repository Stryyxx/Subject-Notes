			<p class="p1">
				The 1939 White Paper was a policy document issued by the British government in response to the escalating
				tensions in Palestine. It sought to limit Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine, while also
				proposing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within ten years. The White Paper was seen as a
				betrayal by Zionist leaders and was met with widespread opposition from the Jewish community.

							The White Paper outlined British policy on several key issues, including immigration, land ownership, and
							the future political status of Palestine. It marked a significant shift from earlier British support for
							the Zionist project.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Immigration Limits:</b> The White Paper limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 over the next five
								years, with further immigration requiring Arab consent.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Land Restrictions:</b> It restricted Jewish land purchases in certain areas of Palestine, aiming to
								prevent further displacement of Arab populations.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Political Future:</b> The document proposed the establishment of a single independent state in
								Palestine within ten years, with power shared between Jews and Arabs.

							The White Paper had a significant impact on Jewish-Arab relations, intensifying tensions as both
							communities saw the document as a threat to their national aspirations.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Jewish Opposition:</b> Zionist leaders condemned the White Paper as a betrayal of the Balfour
								Declaration and the Jewish people, leading to increased tensions with Britain.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Arab Reaction:</b> While some Arab leaders saw the White Paper as a positive step, others rejected
								it, demanding more immediate independence and complete cessation of Jewish immigration.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Escalation of Violence:</b> The restrictions on immigration and land purchases led to an escalation
								in violence between Jews, Arabs, and the British authorities.
