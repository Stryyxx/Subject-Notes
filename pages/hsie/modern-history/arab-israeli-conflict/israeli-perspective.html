				The Israeli perspective on the conflict is shaped by historical ties to the land, religious beliefs, and the
				desire for a secure homeland. Zionism plays a central role in this narrative, advocating for the
				re-establishment of a Jewish state in the ancestral land of Palestine.

							Zionism is a nationalist movement that emerged in the late 19th century, advocating for the return of Jews
							to their ancestral homeland in Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Historical Roots:</b> The movement was driven by the persecution of Jews in Europe and the desire to
								create a safe and independent Jewish state.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Jerusalem:</b> Central to Zionist aspirations, Jerusalem is viewed as the historic and eternal
								capital of the Jewish people.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Immigration Waves:</b> Significant waves of Jewish immigration to Palestine began in the late 19th
								and early 20th centuries, often in response to anti-Semitic violence in Europe.

							Many Israelis believe in their historical and religious right to the land of Palestine, seeing it as the
							biblical homeland promised to the Jewish people by God. This belief has been a driving force behind the
							establishment and expansion of the state of Israel.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Biblical Promises:</b> The belief that God promised the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac,
								and Jacob.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Historical Presence:</b> Archaeological evidence and historical records are cited to support Jewish
								claims to the land.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>International Support:</b> The Balfour Declaration and subsequent international agreements recognized
								the right of Jews to establish a homeland in Palestine.
