			<p class="p1">
				Cell structure refers to the organization of all components within a cell. This includes the membrane,
				cytoplasm, and various organelles that perform specific functions. Understanding cell structure is crucial for
				comprehending how biological systems function at a molecular level.

					<div id="cellMembraneDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a bi-layer made of phospholipids that encloses
							the cell. It regulates what enters and exits the cell and provides protection and structure. Embedded
							proteins within the membrane assist in communication and transport processes.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Phospholipid Bilayer:</b> Comprised of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, creating a
								semi-permeable barrier.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Proteins:</b> Integral and peripheral proteins play roles in signaling, transport, and maintaining
								the cell's shape.
							</li>
							<li><b>Cholesterol:</b> Adds fluidity and stability to the membrane, affecting membrane permeability.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div id="cytoplasmDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance within the cell membrane that contains all the organelles and
							cell parts. It is composed mainly of water, salts, and proteins. The cytoplasm helps to move materials
							around the cell and also dissolves cellular waste.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li><b>Cytosol:</b> The fluid component where metabolic reactions occur.</li>
							<li>
								<b>Cytoskeleton:</b> A network of fibers that provides support, shape, and facilitates movement of the
								cell and its organelles.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<button class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDetails('nucleusDetails')">
						<span>Nucleus</span>
						<span id="arrow-nucleusDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="nucleusDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing the cell's DNA and managing activities such as
							growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope that protects the DNA from
							damage.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Nuclear Envelope:</b> A double membrane that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm and regulates
								material exchange.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Nucleolus:</b> A dense region where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is produced, essential for protein
								synthesis.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Chromatin:</b> A combination of DNA and proteins that condenses to form chromosomes during cell
								division.
							</li>

						<span id="arrow-mitochondriaDetails">▼</span>

					<div id="mitochondriaDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. They generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine
							triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Inner and Outer Membranes:</b> The inner membrane folds to form cristae, which increase surface area
								for ATP production.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Matrix:</b> Contains enzymes crucial for the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), where energy production
								occurs.
							</li>

						<span id="arrow-endoplasmicReticulumDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="endoplasmicReticulumDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubules within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It plays a
							major role in the synthesis of proteins and lipids.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Rough ER:</b> Studded with ribosomes and involved in the synthesis of proteins destined for export
								out of the cell.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Smooth ER:</b> Lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium
								storage.

						<span id="arrow-golgiApparatusDetails">▼</span>
					</button>
					<div id="golgiApparatusDetails" class="dropdown-content hidden">
						<p>
							The Golgi apparatus is the cell's packaging and distribution center. It modifies, sorts, and packages
							proteins and lipids for storage or transport out of the cell.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li><b>Cisternae:</b> Stacked, membrane-bound structures that process and package proteins.</li>
							<li><b>Vesicles:</b> Transport materials to and from the Golgi apparatus.</li>
