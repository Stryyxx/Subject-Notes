				Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in cells without being consumed. They play a
				crucial role in metabolism, facilitating the conversion of substrates into products.

							Enzymes lower the activation energy of chemical reactions, allowing them to proceed faster. Each enzyme is
							specific to a particular reaction or set of reactions.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Active Site:</b> The region on the enzyme where the substrate binds, facilitating the reaction.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Substrate Specificity:</b> Enzymes are specific to their substrates, meaning each enzyme only
								catalyzes a specific reaction.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Cofactors and Coenzymes:</b> Non-protein molecules that assist in enzyme activity, often by carrying
								chemical groups between reactions.

						<p>
							Enzymes are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and substrate concentration.
							These factors affect the enzyme's activity and efficiency.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Temperature:</b> Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which it functions most efficiently; too
								high or too low can denature the enzyme.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>pH:</b> Enzymes also have an optimal pH range; deviations from this range can reduce activity or
								denature the enzyme.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Concentration:</b> Increasing substrate concentration increases reaction rate to a point, after which
								the enzymes become saturated.
