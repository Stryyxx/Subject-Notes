			<p class="p1">
				Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical
				energy, storing it in the bonds of glucose molecules. This process is vital for life on Earth as it provides the
				primary energy source for nearly all ecosystems.

							Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is used to convert carbon
							dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Light Reactions:</b> The first stage, where light energy is captured and used to produce ATP and
								NADPH.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Calvin Cycle:</b> The second stage, where ATP and NADPH are used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Chlorophyll:</b> The primary pigment involved in photosynthesis, absorbing light most efficiently in
								the blue and red parts of the spectrum.

							Photosynthesis is not only crucial for plants but also for all living organisms, as it is the foundation
							of the food chain and is responsible for the oxygenation of the atmosphere.
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								<b>Energy Source:</b> Provides energy-rich glucose for plants, which is then used by other organisms in
								the food chain.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Oxygen Production:</b> Releases oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for the respiration of
								aerobic organisms.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Carbon Cycle:</b> Plays a critical role in the carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the
								atmosphere and storing it in organic molecules.
